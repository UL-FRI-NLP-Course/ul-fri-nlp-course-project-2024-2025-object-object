# Natural language processing course: `Integrating Structured Knowledge into Large Language Models`

## About

This project explores techniques for improving Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating structured knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs). Focusing on Slovenian linguistic data from the Slovenian Digital Dictionary Database, we aim to improve the model's ability to accurately answer complex questions by leveraging semantic relationships. This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for our experiments with various KG integration methods, including direct input augmentation, graph embedding-based integration, and attention-based fusion techniques.

## Repository Organization

- `/docs/`: Project documentation, literature review, and methodology details.
- `/data/`: Processed dataset files containing Slovenian linguistic data and knowledge graphs.
- `/notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, preprocessing.
- `/src/`: Source code for implementing KG integration techniques and model evaluation.
- `/results/`: Performance analysis, evaluation reports, and visualizations.
